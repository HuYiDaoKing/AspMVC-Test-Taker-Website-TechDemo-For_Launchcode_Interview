<h2>User Management</h2><br />
Currently Admin can create other admins by clicking on this link: @Html.ActionLink("Register New Admin", "RegisterAdmin", "Account") <br />
Admins created currently have the same priledges as the creating admin. <br /><br />

Future Updates will: <br />
1. Limit the CanEdit role (admin) to a CanUserManage role (superadmin). <br />
2. Allow super admin to delete any user <br />
3. List all users in this index.
