# Custom-Test-Asp.net-MVC-5-Demo-App
Runs in Asp.net MVC 5 and made in Visual Studio 2015. A video showcasing some of the features (but not all as the video is older than the final release) can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak5BkZy2V0o

TL's Demo Project for Launchcode to show off skills with C#. Is a web app that allows users to make custom tests, with custom questions, and then take the test. Has Authorization, and uses databases.
Most functions are commented and should make sense.

Currently as of 2/6/2017 the features are as follows:
1. Make your own tests
2. Add your own questions to said tests
3. Take a randomized version of the test you made
4. Question correctness authentication
5. Score page
6. Print tests out using the "print test" link
7. Registration
8. Authorization; anonymous, user, and admin
9. All data is stored in databases

Pending features:
1. ToPDF option for "print test"
2. Profile page
3. Users make their own tests in a user section.

Other notes:
Most code is commented for clarity. If you don't understand, I'm sorry I can't help you. This application is for demo purposes for my job search. So unless you are an employer, no support is being offered.
